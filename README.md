- Hello, My name is Jacob Neeley (@jacneeley).
- I am currently working on starting my career in tech as a software developer, but more specifically, I am currently invested in my journey in figuring out what areas of software developement I truly enjoy.

- I started my journey in the classroom learning C#. Since my first programming class, I have picked up a little SQL, HTML, CSS, a little bit of Javascript, and I am currently learning python (i enjoy it a lot more than C# haha). The next language on my roadmap is Java. 

- Most of my experience lies in backend, because frontend seems scary for whatever reason.

- Hopefully as time goes on this readme will look more cool.

- You can reach me via email jacneeley@outlook.com
